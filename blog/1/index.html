				<h1>Moving to the US</h1>
				
				<p>I was born in Russia in 2003. My parents both worked full time, and while we were better off than a lot of others (my parents owned an apartment they wouldn't be able to afford otherwise because of privatization after the collapse of the USSR, and they had relatively good jobs, in programming and business), there was still a lot left to be desired. We could afford food, shelter, clothes, and some entertainment, and live pretty comfortably overall. We couldn’t afford to go on vacation, or spend money on a lot of things that were nice-to-haves. My parents knew there was a possibility of a better future in the US, but had not considered it to be actually plausible. Immigrating there was a daunting task. But one day, the company my dad worked for closed their offices in St. Petersburg, they offered a few of their best employees the chance to go work at an office in London or New York City instead, and they would provide them with a work VISA. My parents decided to take that opportunity. At first, my dad went to work at the NY office for 6 months, while my mother and I stayed back in St Petersburg, where she continued to work at her job and I went to school. My dad working in the US and the rest of the family living in Russia was not a good permanent solution by any means, so either he needed to come back, or we needed to come to the US. Needless to say, we chose the latter. So, we left everything behind. We left behind our friends and family, nearly all of our possessions, the comfort of being in a place where you can speak the language that others around you do as well, and so much more. I was not happy about this. In my mind, my life was ruined. I was leaving everything behind, and I thought that life in the US would be immeasurably worse. We got on a plane, and flew to JFK airport. We didn’t land with just the clothes on our backs, like a lot of other immigrants before us. We were lucky.  My dad had already been working here for a bit of time, so we had money, and a place to stay. Shelter, food, and big ambitions. Everything else we were going to have to figure out. My first impression of New York was not great. I had already lived in a city most of my life, but I found it to be loud and dirty, and I was not a fan. It wasn’t just the physical city that I did not like, though. What was perhaps worse, was that everyone I saw I was unable to communicate with. At least, not linguistically. I could wave, point, and use the 10 or so english words I knew at the time. But I could not speak their language, and they could not speak mine. I had only my two parents to talk with. With time, the city grew on me. We lived there for a few months, during the summer. While my dad was at work, I would go outside and play with my mom. We would go to nearby playgrounds, parks, and feed pigeons with Cheerios that my mom brought in her purse just for that. Cheerios, and cereal in general, was a foreign concept to me at the time. Back in Russia, I would eat oatmeal, or other types of porridge for breakfast almost every day. On rare occasions, it would be something with an egg, but never any wheat products, or whatever cereal is made of. Eating oatmeal/porridge for breakfast everyday was a soviet thing that my parents grew up doing, and that stayed with them. Because of that, I saw cereal unfit for eating, and the one box of Cheerios that we bought was to be fed to the pigeons by the fountain. Living in the city without any responsibilities was fun, but temporary. Summer was ending, and school was soon to start. My parents didn’t want to send me to school in the city, and they got tired of living in it. They started looking for a town that was a commutable distance, had good schools, wasn’t too expensive, had low crime rates, and some other things. Fairfield wasn’t perfect, no place ever is, but it was good enough. So, Fairfield it was. We rented a tiny 700 square foot, 2 bedroom house, and I started going to McKinley. The physical environment was different, but the social one the same, at least at first. There was a language barrier, and a lot of new people I didn’t know. With time, there were less and less new people, and more and more familiar faces. It was very different from the city, where I could go outside and see hundreds of people, for the first and last time that day. With even more time, the language barrier started to fade as well. But the transition was painful. The first few months at school were fine. No one really paid attention to me. There was a 5th grader that would occasionally come into my first grade classroom, that also spoke Russian, and would explain things to me. How people did things, my school assignments, and everything else I needed to know. That allowed me to speak to someone other than my parents, or my extended family through Skype. As weeks turned into months, and months turned into years, my English got better, and I started interacting with other kids at my school. That did not fare well. I was an easy target for bullying then. When I kept to myself, my classmates left me alone, but when I started joining their games and sitting with them at lunch, all bets were off. I was a fair target for bullying. And a good one at that. I had fairly long, very blonde hair (goldilocks was a common insult), and terrible English, which rendered me unable to defend myself (verbally). As a human, and humans need to socialize with their peers to survive, I preferred being bullied by my classmates to not interacting with them at all. It wasn’t all bad, though. They would call me names, but let me play soccer with them on the field. Make fun of me, but still invite me to play boardgames when it was raining and we couldn’t go outside for recess. A few years into living in Fairfield, my thoughts on moving to the US had remained the same. I had lost everything, and not gained much, if anything of value at all, in return.</p>
