				<sub>My mother with me in the stroller in the streets of St. Petersburg</sub>
				<p>I was born in St. Petersburg, Russia in 2003. We lived in the city where I went to pre-school and later grade school, and I spent my summers at a Dacha in the exurbs or in my great-grandparents village.</p>

				<p>My favorite toys as a child were construction sets and other building-related toys. I was always making things from Lego blocks, building complex wooden train tracks with interchanges and multiple story bridges, or making things out of snow/in sandboxes.</p>

				<p>When my dad let me use his work computer at the age of 6-7, I programmed simple games and tools in C#. Simple things like console calculators and number guessing games at first, and more complex interface-based ones later on.</p>
